<https://jwodder.github.io/kbits>

- When the site is first published:
    - Update the original Gists (for those posts that originated as Gists) to
      point to the site

- Necessary settings for GitHub repository:
    - Settings > GitHub Pages > Source: gh-pages branch
        - See <https://git.io/JJzXD>
    - Set up a GitHub Action to build & deploy the site

- Add a favicon?
- Add an author autopage
- Do whatever <https://github.com/pelican-plugins/seo> says
