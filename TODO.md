**Goal**: Create a `jwodder/kbits` repository on GitHub that is published as
<https://jwodder.github.io/kbits>

- When the site is first published:
    - Update the original Gists (for those posts that originated as Gists) to
      point to the site

- Add a favicon?
- Add an author autopage
- Do whatever <https://github.com/pelican-plugins/seo> says
