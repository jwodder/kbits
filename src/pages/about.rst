About This Site
===============

`Knowledge Bits` is a blog (for lack of a better word) consisting of reference
articles I've written up because just finding out their contents was harder
than it should have been.

This site is built using `Pelican <https://getpelican.com>`_ with `my own
custom theme <https://github.com/jwodder/kbits-theme>`_.
