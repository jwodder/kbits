Rust
====

Rust_ is a compiled, statically-typed programming language that focuses on
language stability and "fearless concurrency."  The language enforces memory
safety, not through reference counting & garbage collection, but through
assigning objects ownerships & lifetimes.  Its compiler error messages also
tend to be more helpful than other languages'.
