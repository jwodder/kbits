=================================================
Click â€” Composable Command Line Interface Toolkit
=================================================

Click_ is a Python_ library that allows one to add command-line interfaces to
one's code by augmenting a "main" function with function decorators specifying
the options & arguments the resulting command should take.  It is a
considerable improvement over the Python standard library's ``argparse`` module
(especially when subcommands are involved), and it even comes with utilities
for testing one's commands.
